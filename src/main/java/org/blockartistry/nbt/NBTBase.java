 * Replaces Vanilla's NBTBase.  It improves upon NBTBase with the following:
 * 
 * + Immutable attribute - indicates what tags are immutable once initialized.
 * Helps minimizes impacts of doing copies since immutable objects can be shared
 * without issue.  Currently supported by the primitive types.
 * 
 * + NBTPrimitive move from being from an inner class to it's own class file.
